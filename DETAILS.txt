WebPage 1: HOME PAGE 
    - Links to a page where a new user can enter their information and
    their favorite activities (NEW USER PAGE)
    - Links to another page where a returning user can view their favorite 
    activities (VIEW ACTIVITIES PAGE)

WebPage 2: NEW USER PAGE
    - Consists of a form asking for the user's name, email, and a place where
    they can list their favorite activities (text box?  some sort of option
    selector? look into this)
    - When they submit, it should take them straight to the VIEW ACTIVITIES PAGE

WebPage 3: VIEW ACTIVITIES PAGE  
    - Displays the name of the user
    - Lists the favorite activities of the user in a table 
    - Has a text box where the user can enter a new activity, and upon pressing
    a button next to it, the activity will be added to their list of activities
    and the page will be reloaded.  
    - Has a button where the user can request a random new activity be added to the
    list, and the page will be reloaded.  


Things to figure out: 
    - How to host the site

Important assumptions:
    - nobody will ever re-enter the same name as a new user (so every document will have a unique name)
    - nobody will ever type an invalid name into the returning users page.
    - nobody will ever type in an activity that already exists on their table
    - the random activity generator will never generate an activity that already exists on their table
